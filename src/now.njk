<div class="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
  <p>This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/now page</a>, inspired by Derek Sivers. It's a snapshot of what I'm focused on right now—updated regularly to reflect my current work, projects, and life.</p>

  <h2>Life & Work</h2>
  <p>I recently graduated in <strong>April 2025</strong> with a <strong>Bachelor of Arts in English (Honours)</strong> from Mount Royal University with a 3.8 GPA. My honours thesis, <em>How the English Degree Will Save the World</em>, examined the transformative potential of literary studies and introduced "bloodwriting" as a bridge between Indigenous knowledge and digital practices.</p>
  
  <p>I'm currently focused on building <strong><a href="https://berryhouse.ca">🍓 Berry House</a></strong>, my new initiative offering JAMstack web development and content strategy services. Berry House helps independent creators, non-profits, and small teams build fast, accessible websites while maintaining ownership of their content and platform.</p>
