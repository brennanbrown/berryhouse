  <h1>Understanding the IndieWeb</h1>
  <p>The <strong>IndieWeb</strong> is a movement for a more independent, human-centric web. It encourages you to own your content, identity, and data—rather than relying solely on centralized platforms.</p>

  <h2>Core Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Own your content</strong>: Publish on your site first, then syndicate elsewhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Own your identity</strong>: Your domain is your identity.</li>
    <li><strong>Make what you need</strong>: Build small tools and workflows that work for you.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Start a personal site with a static site generator (we use Eleventy).</li>
    <li>Add microformats and feeds; consider webmentions and POSSE later.</li>
    <li>Write short notes and posts—show your work as you learn.</li>
  </ul>
