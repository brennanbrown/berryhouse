Today marks the official launch of **Berry House**—a small, values-driven studio focused on building fast, accessible websites and thoughtful content. But more than that, it's a commitment to reclaiming the internet from algorithm-driven homogeneity and returning it to something more human, creative, and meaningful.

## What is Berry House?

Berry House operates on a dual mission:

1. **Professional JAMstack development and content strategy** for corporate clients, independent creators, and small teams who want to own their platform
2. **Pro bono and pay-what-you-can services** for marginalized communities, vulnerable individuals, and low-income nonprofits

Every paid project helps subsidize accessible services for those who need them most. It's a model that lets me do what I love—building clean, fast, accessible websites—while making a real difference for communities that are often priced out of quality web services.

## Why Now?

I've been building open-source themes and tools for years. Projects like [Enjoyment Work](https://enjoyment-work.netlify.app) [Purelog](https://purelog.netlify.app), [11ty IndieWeb Blog Starter](https://github.com/brennanbrown/11ty-Indie-Web-Blog-Starter), [RetroWeird](https://github.com/brennanbrown/retroweird), and [Campfire](https://github.com/brennanbrown/Campfire-Hugo-Theme) have collectively received hundreds of stars and been used by creators worldwide. But I kept seeing the same problem: **people wanted custom implementations and didn't know where to start**.

After graduating with my BA in English (Honours) from Mount Royal University this past April—completing my thesis on how literary studies can transform digital practices—I realized it was time to formalize this work. Berry House is the culmination of:

- **Technical expertise**: Full-stack development training through SAIT and InceptionU, growth marketing through OnRamp, and years of JAMstack development
- **Writing and content strategy**: An English degree focused on rhetoric, narrative craft, and inclusive communication
- **Community building**: Three years leading Write Club, facilitating workshops, and creating spaces for emerging voices

## Building This Site: By the Numbers

I practice what I preach. This site is built with the same tools and principles I offer clients:

### Tech Stack
- **Static Site Generator**: Eleventy 3.0 (blazing fast, zero client-side JavaScript for core functionality)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Typography**: Google Fonts—Space Grotesk for headers, Public Sans for body
- **Hosting**: Netlify (JAMstack-optimized, global CDN)
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub (transparent, collaborative workflow)

### Performance & Accessibility
- **Build time**: ~8.5 seconds for 67 pages
- **Lighthouse scores**: 100/100 across the board (performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO)
- **Web Vitals**: All metrics in the green
- **Accessibility features**: 
  - Reduce motion toggle (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`)
  - High contrast mode
  - Font size controls
  - System fonts toggle
  - Semantic HTML throughout
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### IndieWeb Ready
- **Microformats2**: h-card, h-entry for machine-readable content
- **Webmentions**: Integrated with webmention.io
- **RSS/Atom feed**: Full-text feed at `/feed.xml`
- **No tracking**: Privacy-first analytics with Plausible (no cookies, aggregated data only)

### The Build Process
Just as an example, my last feature update for this site included:

- Generated **11 icon formats** from a single logo (favicons, Apple touch icons, PWA icons, OG images)
- Created **custom animations** that respect accessibility preferences
- Integrated **Google Fonts** with fallback to system fonts
- Built a **complete icon generation pipeline** for future updates
- Implemented **SEO optimization** (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, structured data)
- Set up **GitHub Sponsors integration** with FUNDING.yml

Everything is version-controlled, documented, and designed to be maintainable long-term. No proprietary platforms. No vendor lock-in. Just clean, portable code you can own.

## What We Offer

### For Corporate Clients & Small Teams
- **Custom JAMstack Development**: Bespoke websites built with Eleventy, Hugo, or Astro
- **Website Migration**: Moving from WordPress, Wix, or other platforms to JAMstack
- **Performance Optimization**: Speed, SEO, and UX improvements
- **Content Strategy**: Information architecture, voice and tone, content calendars
- **Maintenance & Support**: Ongoing updates and troubleshooting

### For Nonprofits & Marginalized Communities
- **Pro Bono Engagements**: Free services for qualifying organizations
- **Pay-What-You-Can**: Sliding scale pricing based on your resources
- **Accessibility Audits**: Free accessibility reviews for community sites
- **Open Office Hours**: Free consultations to discuss your needs

## The Values That Guide This Work

**Digital Autonomy**: You should own your content, data, and platform. No algorithmic feeds. No platform lock-in.

**Accessibility & Inclusivity**: Fast, semantic, keyboard-navigable sites that work for everyone—including people using assistive technology.

**Sustainability**: Calm technology you can maintain without a team. Low overhead, long-term thinking.

**Transparency**: Open source where possible. Clear communication. Plain language documentation.

**Community**: Building spaces where emerging voices can be heard. Amplifying marginalized perspectives.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. In the coming weeks and months, you can expect:

- **Case studies** showcasing client work and outcomes
- **Educational content** on JAMstack, IndieWeb principles, and accessible design
- **Open-source tools** to help you build your own independent web presence
- **Community resources** including templates, guides, and workshops

I'm also continuing my work with [Write Club](https://writeclub.ca/)—now as Founder rather than President—and maintaining my open-source themes and tools.

## Let's Build Something That Lasts

If you're reading this and thinking, *"I need a website that's fast, accessible, and truly mine"*—let's talk.

If you're a nonprofit or marginalized creator who needs web support but can't afford typical agency rates—**reach out**. That's exactly why Berry House exists.

And if you're already building in this space—on the IndieWeb, with JAMstack, championing accessibility—let's connect. The future of the web is collaborative, not competitive.
