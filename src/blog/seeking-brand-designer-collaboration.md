Berry House is growing, and we're ready to establish a visual identity that truly reflects who we are and what we stand for. We're seeking a talented brand designer (or design team) to collaborate with us on creating a comprehensive brand identity system from the ground up.

## Who We Are

Berry House is a small, values-driven studio that builds fast, accessible websites and thoughtful content for independent creators, nonprofits, and mission-led organizations. We believe in:

- **Human-centered design** — Content first, technology second
- **Digital autonomy** — Helping people own their platforms and content
- **Accessibility and inclusion** — Building for everyone, not just some
- **Long-term stewardship** — Creating sustainable, maintainable solutions
- **Community over growth** — Quality relationships over scale

We work primarily with Eleventy, Tailwind CSS, and JAMstack technologies, emphasizing performance, privacy, and progressive enhancement. Our approach is calm, considered, and collaborative.

## What We're Looking For

We need a complete visual identity system that captures our ethos of thoughtful, sustainable web craft. Here's what we're envisioning:

### Core Identity Elements

**Logo & Mark**
- Primary logo that works across digital and print
- Simplified mark/icon for social media and favicons
- Variations for different contexts (horizontal, stacked, monogram)
- Clear usage guidelines and minimum size requirements

**Color Palette**
- Primary and secondary color schemes
- Accessible color combinations (WCAG AA compliant)
- Dark mode considerations
- Semantic color meanings (success, warning, error states)
- Color values in multiple formats (hex, RGB, HSL)

**Typography System**
- Primary typeface for headings and display text
- Secondary typeface for body text and UI
- Font pairing rationale and hierarchy guidelines
- Web font optimization considerations
- Fallback font stacks

### Extended Brand Assets

**Visual Language**
- Iconography style and approach
- Illustration style (if applicable)
- Photography direction and treatment
- Graphic elements and patterns
- Spacing and layout principles

**Brand Applications**
- Website header/navigation treatment
- Social media templates and covers
- Email signature design
- Business card and letterhead concepts
- Presentation template basics

### Brand Guidelines & Documentation

**Comprehensive Brand Book**
- Brand story and positioning
- Logo usage dos and don'ts
- Color palette with accessibility notes
- Typography hierarchy and usage
- Voice and tone guidelines (we'll collaborate on this)
- Application examples across different media
- File organization and naming conventions

**Digital Asset Kit**
- Logo files in multiple formats (SVG, PNG, PDF)
- Color swatches and palettes
- Font files and licensing information
- Icon sets and graphic elements
- Template files for common applications

## Our Design Philosophy

We're drawn to design that feels:

- **Warm but professional** — Approachable without being casual
- **Clean and uncluttered** — Letting content breathe
- **Timeless over trendy** — Built to last, not chase fads
- **Accessible and inclusive** — Readable, navigable, welcoming
- **Craft-focused** — Showing attention to detail and care

We appreciate design that nods to traditional publishing and editorial design while feeling distinctly digital-native. Think more *A List Apart* or *Offscreen Magazine* than Silicon Valley startup.

## What We Bring to the Table

**Clear Vision & Values**
We know who we are and what we stand for. We can provide detailed briefs, quick feedback, and collaborative input throughout the process.

**Technical Implementation**
We'll handle all the technical integration—from optimizing assets for web performance to implementing the design system in our codebase.

**Content & Copy**
We'll take care of all written content, messaging strategy, and voice/tone development. You focus on the visual.

**Long-term Partnership**
We're not looking for a one-and-done project. We want to build a relationship with a designer who can grow with us as we expand our services and reach.

## Project Timeline & Process

**Discovery Phase (2-3 weeks)**
- Brand questionnaire and strategy session
- Competitive analysis and visual research
- Mood boards and initial direction exploration

**Design Development (3-4 weeks)**
- Logo concepts and refinement
- Color and typography exploration
- Initial brand applications

**Finalization & Documentation (2-3 weeks)**
- Final asset creation and optimization
- Brand guidelines development
- Asset organization and delivery

**Total Timeline: 7-10 weeks**

We believe in collaborative iteration rather than big reveals. Expect regular check-ins, shared Figma files, and ongoing dialogue throughout the process.

## Budget & Compensation

We understand that quality brand work is an investment. We're prepared to compensate fairly for comprehensive brand identity work and are open to discussing project fees, hourly rates, or retainer arrangements based on your preferred working style.

We're also interested in exploring partnership opportunities for designers who align with our values and might want ongoing collaboration on client projects.

## How to Apply

If this resonates with you, we'd love to hear from you. Please send us:

1. **Portfolio samples** — Show us 2-3 brand identity projects you're proud of
2. **Brief introduction** — Tell us about your design philosophy and approach
3. **Process overview** — How do you typically approach brand identity projects?
4. **Timeline availability** — When could you potentially start?
5. **Budget expectations** — What's your typical range for this scope of work?

**Email us at: [mail@berryhouse.ca](mailto:mail@berryhouse.ca)**

## Questions We're Happy to Answer

- What's your current brand direction or visual preferences?
- How do you handle revisions and feedback?
- What file formats and deliverables do you need?
- Are you open to remote collaboration?
- What's your experience with accessibility considerations?
- Do you work with developers on implementation?

## A Note on Fit

We're looking for someone who genuinely connects with our mission of building a more human, accessible, and sustainable web. If you're excited about working with mission-driven organizations, care deeply about craft and accessibility, and want to create something meaningful rather than just trendy, we'd love to talk.

We particularly welcome applications from designers who are:
- Part of underrepresented communities in design
- Passionate about accessibility and inclusive design
- Interested in the intersection of design and social impact
- Experienced with small business and nonprofit branding
