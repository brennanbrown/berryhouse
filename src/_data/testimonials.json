I believe Brennan would be an incredible asset to any potential employer.",

I can without hesitation recommend him for any full stack, front end or back end role. Any software company would be fortunate to have him join their team.",

During OnRamp, he demonstrated strengths in content development & copywriting (blog, sales sheet), campaign design and marketing fundamentals. He always asked really great, thoughtful questions, contributed new ideas and supported his fellow cohort participants when they needed help. Plus his technical coding aptitude gave him a leg-up when tackling the more technical side of marketing tools. He was a pleasure to work with!",

    "comment": "Strong, community orientated leader who I have had the pleasure of working with. Acting as the Founding President of Mount Royal University’s Creative Writing Club, Kenneth has fostered a strong community where individuals invested in professional and emotional relationships. His ability as a leader has enabled others to grow, and his conscientiousness is an asset in making hard decisions. In terms of specific skills, being an English Honours student alongside Kenneth affirms that he is skillful in editing, proofreading, critical analysis, and he has a keen attention to detail that makes him reliable in any project format. Kenneth’s knack for managing websites also proves that he has skills outside of his degree and he is a proficient article writer on Medium, striking cold facts and personal truth that adds to the depth of his writing ability. Thoughtful, sharp, and adaptable.",
