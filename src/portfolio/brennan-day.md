A personal blog following IndieWeb principles, built with Eleventy and hosted on Netlify. The site embodies the IndieWeb ethos of owning your domain, data, and identity.

Key features:
- **IndieWeb-ready**: Microformats2 markup (h-card, h-entry, h-feed)
- **Webmentions support** via webmention.io
- **RSS/Atom feeds** for content syndication
- **Custom domain** via Porkbun
- **Version controlled** content as plain text files
- **Dark mode** with Gruvbox-inspired color scheme
- **Semantic HTML5** with accessibility in mind
- **No tracking** or analytics by default

The site is designed to be a permanent, stable home for my writing and thoughts on the web, with full data ownership and portability.
