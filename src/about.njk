  <h2>Why we started this initiative</h2>
  <p>We’re carving out a humane corner of the internet—one that values autonomy, creativity, and long‑term stewardship over growth at all costs. Our work combines lean, privacy‑respecting tech (Eleventy/JAMstack) with editorial craft and community engagement. We ship small, sustainable projects that people can actually own.</p>
