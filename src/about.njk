    <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mt-3 max-w-3xl">We’re a small, values‑driven studio building fast, accessible websites and community‑centered content. We help independent creators and mission‑led orgs publish with clarity and care.</p>

  <h2>Why we started this initiative</h2>
  <p>We’re carving out a humane corner of the internet—one that values autonomy, creativity, and long‑term stewardship over growth at all costs. Our work combines lean, privacy‑respecting tech (Eleventy/JAMstack) with editorial craft and community engagement. We ship small, sustainable projects that people can actually own.</p>
